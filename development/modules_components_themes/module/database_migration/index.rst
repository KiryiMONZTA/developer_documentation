Database Migration
==================

Modules can have their own migrations. To get comprehensive information about how we can configure
and run them, check :doc:`database migrations documentation <../../../tell_me_about/migrations>`.

Also you need to know that module migrations can be generated and executed by using
`OXID eShop Doctrine Migration Wrapper <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxideshop-doctrine-migration-wrapper>`__.

Module migrations are available from version 6.2.2
