Database Migration
==================

Modules can have their own migrations and can be generated and executed by using
`OXID eShop Doctrine Migration Wrapper <https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxideshop-doctrine-migration-wrapper>`__.
check :doc:`OXID eShop uses database migrations documentation <../../../tell_me_about/migrations>` for more information.
